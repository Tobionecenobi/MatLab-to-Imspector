# MatLab-to-Imspector
Examples of how Matlab talks with Imspector using the Matlabinterface. 

I have replicated parts of the Imspector [python interface examples](https://imspectordocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specpy/examples.html) in MatLab.

Remember to run MatLab as adminstrator. 

Hope this will save other peoples time.
